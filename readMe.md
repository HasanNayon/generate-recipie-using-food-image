# Cooking by Sight: Generate Recipe from Food Image

Welcome to "Cooking by Sight"! This is a deep learning school project aimed at generating recipes from food images using state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

## Overview

In today's fast-paced world, cooking can be both an enjoyable hobby and a necessity. However, sometimes finding the right recipe for a dish can be challenging, especially when you don't know the name of the dish or its ingredients. "Cooking by Sight" aims to solve this problem by allowing users to simply take a picture of the food they want to cook and generate a recipe based on that image.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Our deep learning model can accurately identify various types of food items in an image.
- **Recipe Generation**: Once the food is identified, the system generates a recipe based on the recognized ingredients.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The generated recipes are presented in a human-readable format, making them easy to follow.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive user interface makes it easy for users to interact with the system.

## Usage

To use "Cooking by Sight," follow these simple steps:

1. Upload an image of the food you want to cook.
2. Wait for the system to identify the food items in the image.
3. View the generated recipe based on the identified ingredients.
4. Follow the steps in the recipe to cook your dish!
