#### For Sugar Syrup:
- 1 cup sugar
- 3 cups water
- 2-3 green cardamom pods, crushed

### Instructions:
1. **Prepare Paneer (Chenna):**
   - In a large pot, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
   - Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and add lemon juice or vinegar gradually while stirring continuously.
   - The milk will curdle, and the whey will separate from the curdled milk solids (paneer). If necessary, add more lemon juice or vinegar until the whey becomes clear.
   - Turn off the heat and strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth or fine sieve. Rinse the paneer under cold water to remove any traces of lemon juice or vinegar.
   - Gather the cloth with the paneer inside and squeeze out excess water. Hang the paneer for 30 minutes to drain any remaining water.

2. **Knead the Paneer:**
   - Transfer the drained paneer to a clean surface or a mixing bowl.
   - Knead the paneer with the heel of your hand until it becomes smooth and soft. This may take about 5-7 minutes.

3. **Shape the Cham Cham:**
   - Divide the paneer mixture into equal-sized portions and shape them into cylindrical or oval-shaped dumplings.
   - Flatten the dumplings slightly and make a slight indentation in the center of each cham cham with your thumb or the back of a spoon.

4. **Cook the Cham Cham:**
   - In a wide pan or kadai, bring water to a boil.
   - Gently slide the shaped cham cham into the boiling water.
   - Cover and cook the cham cham over medium-low heat for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and doubled in size. They will become spongy and float to the surface when cooked.
   - Once cooked, remove the cham cham from the water and let them cool slightly.

5. **Prepare Sugar Syrup:**
   - In another saucepan, combine sugar, water, and crushed cardamom pods to make the sugar syrup.
   - Bring the syrup to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves completely.
   - Let the syrup simmer for a few minutes until it slightly thickens. Turn off the heat.

6. **Soak the Cham Cham:**
   - Gently drop the cooked cham cham into the prepared sugar syrup.
   - Let them soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the sweetness and flavor.

7. **Serve:**
   - Once soaked, remove the cham cham from the sugar syrup and arrange them on a serving plate.
   - Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds.

   - Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) to the mixture. Keep stirring until it thickens and starts leaving the sides of the pan. This should take around 10-15 minutes.

3. **Shape the Pedhas:**
